        <hr>
        <p>48 Degrees is an Australian independent business that organises in-house inspection and maintenance for construction work. When a construction project is completed, an inspection of the site will be carried out. Depending on the condition, the business will then hire a subcontractor to fix the issue. The appropriate subcontractor will be chosen based on a few factors, including history of work with 48 Degrees and cost. 48 Degrees also gets the client in touch with subcontractors and allows subcontractors to finish their job. The client will be given a warranty period included in the package for property maintenance. </p>
