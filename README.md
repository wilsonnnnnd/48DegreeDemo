# 48 Degree Demo Website

The purpose of the report is to demonstrate Team 27’s understanding of 48 Degrees, the current issues the business is facing, and the required future changes. 
48 Degrees can significantly benefit from the introduction of some technological solutions. There is a range of pain points that are diminishing from 48 Degrees’ profits and overall business efficiency.
As per the initial analysis the current manual file system is inefficient and there is no website reducing accessibility. Due to this the key requirements that have been found are:
Inspector management 
Subcontractor management
Project information management
Manage customer interactions and information
Allow for customer testimonials to be uploaded
Website improves online presence
Allow direct communication between customer and 48 Degrees staff


## Description

The lack of a website introduces an opportunity for 48 Degrees to increase both their presence, and the number of potential customers. As such, having a 48 Degrees website is a high priority as it can allow for new customers to find 48 Degrees, and provide information to both service customers and subcontractors. The requirement of allocating, managing and contacting inspectors and subcontractors are essential and high priority as such should be worked on as soon as the website's features are added.
As an agile development project will run in iterations. After each iteration both the team and 48 Degrees will review and change aspects of the project. The current timeline for this project is for iteration 1 to be completed by 15/04/2021, iteration 2 complete on 07/05/2021 and a go-live date of 20/05/2021. At these dates particularly Team 27 will work closely with 48 Degrees to assure the project is underway in a suitable manner.
The current risks Team 27 is taking into consideration for the undertaking of the project are the limited time to get detailed information from the 48 Degrees client, the inexperience working in website development, and the migration of the large amount of data from the old system to the new system.
